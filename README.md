<h1>Machine Learning Coursework</h1>

This repository contains my completed assignments and projects from a Machine Learning course I took in the end of my second year of studies. The work demonstrates my understanding and hands-on application of foundational ML algorithms using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

Each folder corresponds to a core topic in classical machine learning, with self-contained code, datasets, and analysis notebooks.<br><br>
<h2>üìÇ Folder Overview</h2>

    Bayesian Learning
    Naive Bayes classifier implementation and experiments with probabilistic inference.

    Decision Trees
    Implementation of decision trees from scratch (including entropy, information gain, etc.), and solving classification tasks.

    K-Means
    Unsupervised clustering using the K-Means algorithm, visualizations, and analysis of clustering performance.

    Linear Regression
    Linear models for regression tasks, implemented manually. Includes analysis of error and model behavior.

    Logistic Regression
    Binary classification using logistic regression. Gradient descent, sigmoid function, and decision boundary visualizations.

<h2>üìÅ Structure</h2>

Each topic folder includes:

    *.ipynb ‚Äî a Jupyter Notebook with explanations, visualizations, and code walkthroughs

    *.py ‚Äî a Python script with a clean implementation of the algorithm

    *.csv ‚Äî datasets used for testing and analysis

<h2>üõ† Technologies</h2>

    Python 3

    Jupyter Notebooks

    NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (only used in comparison, most code is from scratch)
